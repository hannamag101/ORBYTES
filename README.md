**ORBYTES provides users the ability to interact with an API interface to extract, visualize, and integrate satellite trajectories actively tracked by space-track.org.**

**In addition to mapping the orbital paths of payloads in regions of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Orbit (GEO), ORBYTES functions as a platform for users to gain intuition about the beauty and complexity of orbital mechanics.**

**This knowledge is first established through allowing the user to construct their own orbit models by allowing them to simply input uniquely chosen orbital parameters. Practicing the manipulation of certain orbital parameters (such as a satellite's semi-major axis, inclination, or argument of perigee) enhances the users knowledge on which elements <code style = "color : red"> **1) define the physical shape of an orbit**</code> vs <code style = "color : red"> **2) contribute to how an orbit is oriented in space** </code>.**

**This initial experiment provides a basic understanding how orbits are configured around Earth and helps the user visualize the unique orbital planes which correspond to the integrated motion of the satellite along its pre-determined trajectory.**
___
**Throughout this tutorial, the user will:**
* Establish intuition about coordinate transformations within the Earth-Centered Inertial Frame (ECI)
* Learn about the 7 main orbital elements that define the shape, structure, and orientation of an orbit
* Access archives of data on space-track.org using its Application Programming Interface (API)
* Modify the orbital architecture of orbital shells surrounding Earth to learn about the placement of satellites within larger mega-constellations
* Witness the evolution of the Mean Keplerian Elements of a satellite due to gravitational perturbations from those on adjacent orbital planes
___

This user-friendly package helps gain the neccessary intuition on how contaminated the orbital shells surrounding Earth truly are. Beginning with establishing the context of orbital dynamics, the user quickly is asked to integrate their existing knowledge on orbital trajectories with
